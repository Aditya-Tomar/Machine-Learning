### About Linear Regression

Linear Regression is used o predict continuous value prediction.

In this we use Linear Regression model to predit the house price.
In you will see Three graph which will display when you run this code.

First graph show a line when the model is not trainned.

Second graph will show the cost value decrement with the increasing number of iteration. (if the cost value increases with iteration then model needs some changes.)

Third graph will show you a line when the model is trainned.

In This implementation i used non-polynomial hypothesis.
