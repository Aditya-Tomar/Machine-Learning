###  Support Vector Machine 

A support vector machine is a supervised learning model that can be used for classification and regression problem.
For classification this SVM models try to fit a hyperplane between the different category of the data to classify them such that the margin should be maximum between the support vector.
support vectors are the data points closer to hyperplane which influence the position and orientation of hyperplane.
